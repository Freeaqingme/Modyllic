* Fix false event diffs Events are tricky to handle right, for two reasons:
* Whenever possible, produce error messages rather than exceptions
* Add schema validation as a feature
* Work around MySQL constraint limitations, separating drops from adds.
* Fix handling of marking a column as a primary key-- columns are then marked not null by implication
* Fix false view diffs MySQL compresses the spaces between the AS keyword and the select statement, so we need to parse at least that far.
* Stop rewriting code body blocks when we didn't need to
* Fix guard against events not existing
* Fix #249: Guard against events not existing in MySQL 5.0
