* Resume disabling foreign key checks until such time as we add PREPARE WITH syntax to constraints
* Stop trying to emit PRIMARY KEY and UNIQUE as field attributes
* If we're dropping a table, don't try to add/remove constraints from it
* Move all index/constraint changes to after other table changes, including static data
* If we're making a table static, truncate before we make any changes to it
