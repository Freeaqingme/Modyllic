* Fix PEAR URL to match what Github has forced (github.com->github.io)
* Stop emitting the foreign key dance on static data only changes
* Support a full suite of DML as proc bodies (previously we only supported BEGIN and CALL)
* Add experimental support for PREPARE WITH blocks that can be attached to any foreign key or unique constraint.
  PREPARE WITH blocks will be executed prior to adding that new contstraint
  and should modify the table such that the constraint will pass.
